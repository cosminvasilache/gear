# Notes

- still show excluded items, but mark in some way (strikethrough, gray out, etc...).  
Maybe make this a setting / configuration.  
Good to make sure when some items are banned, like when traveling by plane, so that you don't take them by accident and have them confiscated.
- add some hard include set of rules, that override exclusionList
- maybe allow the tags Set to include arrays (or switch to array instead of set if need be), to allow all tags to be satisfied, not just one
